It is capable of handling multiple files simultaneously and has a wide array of modern features. Here is a picture of **ash** editing this README file:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](./assets/ash-default.png)\r\n\r\n**ash** is written in Python 3.8 using the curses library.\r\n\r\n## Table of Contents\r\n\r\n- [Design Goals](#design-goals)\r\n- [Installation](#installation)\r\n  - Prerequisites\r\n  - Installing **ash**\r\n  - Downloading and setting up the developmental build for **ash**\r\n- [Prebuilt binaries](#prebuilt-binaries)  \r\n- [Colors](#colors)\r\n- [Usage](#usage)\r\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\r\n- [Screenshots](#screenshots)\r\n- [License](#license)\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n\r\n## Design Goals\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of design goals for **ash**:\r\n\r\n- Easy to use\r\n- Clean and intuitive interface\r\n- Minimal dependencies\r\n- Common keybindings\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of features available in **ash**; some of which have already been implemented, while some are yet to be:\r\n\r\n**Already implemented:**\r\n\r\n- Common editor features such as undo/redo, line numbers, find-replace, cut-copy-paste, etc.\r\n- True support for wrapping (both hard & soft) with intuitive cursor movements along wrapped text\r\n- Auto-backup\r\n- Support for Unicode\r\n- Project mode (opening a directory instead of individual files)\r\n- Support for splits/windows\r\n- Support for various text-encodings\r\n- Syntax highlighting (partially implemented)\r\n- Selection highlighting (highlights text under selection wherever they occur in the document)\r\n- Color scheme customization\r\n\r\n**Not yet implemented:**\r\n\r\n- View list of recent files\r\n- Git integration\r\n\r\n**Future goals:**\r\n\r\n- Macros and command-palette\r\n- Autocompletion/Suggestions\r\n- Integrated terminal\r\n- Plugin system\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAs **ash** is still in development, there are no prebuilt binaries available for download. However, if you have python 3.8 installed on your system, you can download and install a released version or run a developmental build for **ash**. For Linux users, follow the following steps to get **ash** on your system:\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\nYou need certain packages and Python 3 itself to download and run the developmental build:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ sudo apt install git\r\n$ sudo apt install xclip\r\n$ sudo apt install python3\r\n$ sudo apt install python3-pip\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Installing ash\r\n\r\nIf you want to install **ash** on your system, download the `.tar.gz` file from the latest release (from the Releases section on GitHub). Extract it a folder, and once inside that folder (make sure it contains the file `setup.py`), execute the following:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ sudo pip3 install .\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo run **ash** make sure you have `:$HOME/.local/bin` appended to your $PATH variable in the file `~/.bashrc`. To execute **ash**, see the [Usage](#usage) section.\r\n\r\n### Uninstalling ash\r\n\r\nTo uninstall **ash** you can use:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ sudo pip3 uninstall ash\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Downloading and setting up the developmental build for ash\r\n\r\n**Note:** This section is only for users who want to run the latest build\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ cd ~\r\n$ git clone --depth 1 -b master https://github.com/akashnag/ash.git\r\n$ cd ash/bin\r\n$ sudo chmod +x ash\r\n$ cd ..\r\n$ sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo be able to launch **ash** from anywhere, you need to add `~/ash/bin` to your path by editing your `.bashrc` file:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ sudo nano ~/.bashrc\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen append `:~/ash/bin` to the `PATH` variable. You are now ready to run **ash** from the terminal. See [Usage](#usage) for details.\r\n\r\n## Prebuilt binaries\r\n\r\nSince **ash** is still under development, prebuilt binaries are not yet available. You can use PyInstaller or similar tools to build one for your system.\r\n\r\n## Colors\r\n\r\nIf you are using the default Ubuntu terminal, to enable 256 make sure your `TERM` variable is set to `xterm-256color`. After **ash** runs for the first time, it creates a `.ashrc` file inside your home directory. You can edit that file directly to change how **ash** looks on your system. The RGB triplets listed in that file range from 0--255. If you want to reset **ash** to its default colors, delete the configuration file using: `rm ~/.ashrc`.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nOnce you have downloaded the **ash** source code, and set it up as detailed above, you are ready to use it. \r\n\r\n**NOTES:**\r\n1. If you have not updated your path variable, you must specify the full path to the ash binary.\r\n1. Your terminal resolution should be at least 102 (width) x 22 (height). Opening the editor in a lower resolution may unexpectedly crash the application. This requirement is necessary to properly display the dialog-boxes.\r\n\r\nTo run **ash**:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ ash path/to/file.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nor, to open an empty buffer:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ ash\r\n```\r\n\r\nor, to open a project (directory):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ ash path/to/directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the [Key Bindings](KEYBINDINGS.md) for help on how to navigate in ash.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf you find any bugs, please report them. I am also happy to accept pull requests from anyone for either bug-fixes, performance improvements, or for implementing the not-yet-implemented features listed above. Please consider contributing towards new features **only when** the features listed above have been fully implemented.
