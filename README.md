**ash** is a simple and clean terminal-based text editor, that aims to be easy to use with modern key-bindings. It is capable of handling multiple files simultaneously and has a wide array of modern features. Here is a picture of **ash** editing this README file:

**ash** is written in Python 3.8 using the curses library.

- Command palette
- Basic mouse support (click to select, right-click, drag to select text, double-click to select word, triple-click to select line, drag to move dialog-boxes, etc.)
- Open terminal / execute shell commands
- Limited IDE features like compile, build, execute...
- Supports project/folder specific settings along with global settings
- Multi-language support
- Support for snippets

## Requirements

1. You need a resolution of at least 102 x 22 in your terminal emulator
1. Your terminal must support Unicode and be able to display at least 256 colors with the capability of remapping color palettes (Works best on: `xterm-256`). Monochrome terminals are also partially supported.
1. If you are running the source distribution, you need the GNU C compiler collection besides Python 3.8, as some parts of the application are written in Cython. The first time you run the application, Cython will compile and build the `*.pyx` files, which may increase load time (Ignore the warnings during compilation)

**ash is primarily targetted to Linux. This version of ash has only been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with Python 3.8.2 (64-bit)**

## Installation

*Note: Instructions provided here are for Debian/Ubuntu based systems. For your distribution, you may need to issue different instructions to install the necessary packages.*

### Prerequisites

You need certain packages and Python 3 itself to run **ash** on your system, as there are no prebuilt binaries available yet.

```bash
$ sudo apt install git
$ sudo apt install xclip
$ sudo apt install python3
$ sudo apt install python3-pip
```

Depending on your system, you may also need to install the following packages:

```bash
$ sudo apt install python3-devel
```

### Installing ash

You have multiple options here:

- Install from PyPi **(recommended)**
- Install the latest stable release from GitHub
- Install the latest nightly release from GitHub
- Build and install from source

#### Install from PyPi

Execute the following instructions to install from PyPi:

```bash
$ sudo pip3 install ash-editor
```

The above command downloads **ash** and installs it locally on your system. To be able to invoke **ash** from anywhere, see the [Setting Paths](#setting-paths) section.

#### Install the latest stable release

**Note: the stable release may not contain all features listed above**

Go to the **ash** [Website](https://akashnag.github.io/ash) and download the latest stable release. Then extract the downloaded tar-ball into a folder and once inside that folder, open up your terminal from there and execute:

```bash
$ sudo pip3 install .
```

#### Install the latest nightly release

The nightly builds contains all the latest features of ash. Go to the **ash** [Website](https://akashnag.github.io/ash) and download the latest nightly release. Then extract the downloaded tar-ball into a folder and once inside that folder, open up your terminal from there and execute:

```bash
$ sudo pip3 install .
```

#### Build from source and install

To build from source, issue the following instructions:

```bash
$ sudo apt install git
$ cd ~
$ git clone --depth 1 -b master https://github.com/akashnag/ash.git
$ cd ash
$ python3 setup.py sdist
```

(Though you can install it directly from here, it is not recommended) You will find the new tar-ball created under `dist` directory, from where you can proceed as before by first copying the tarball into a new directory, extracting it, and then installing it.


### Setting paths

To run **ash** make sure you have `:$HOME/.local/bin` appended to your $PATH variable in the file `~/.bashrc` (If you are using `bash` as your shell. If not open your corresponding .rc file). To execute **ash**, see the [Usage](#usage) section.

### Uninstalling ash

To uninstall **ash** you can use:

```bash
$ sudo pip3 uninstall ash-editor
```

## Prebuilt binaries

Since **ash** is still under development, prebuilt binaries are not yet available. You can use PyInstaller or similar tools to build one for your system.


## Usage

Once you have downloaded the **ash** source code, and set it up as detailed above, you are ready to use it.

**NOTES:**

1. If you have not updated your path variable, you must specify the full path to the ash binary.
1. Your terminal resolution should be at least 102 (width) x 22 (height). Opening the editor in a lower resolution may unexpectedly crash the application. This requirement is necessary to properly display the dialog-boxes.
1. It will take a while to start up **ash** for the first time, this is normal. From the second time onwards, it should start up faster.

To run **ash**:

```bash
$ ash path/to/file.txt
```

or, to open an empty buffer:

```bash
$ ash
```

or, to open a project (directory):

```bash
$ ash path/to/directory
```

See the [Key Bindings](KEYBINDINGS.md) for help on how to navigate in ash.
